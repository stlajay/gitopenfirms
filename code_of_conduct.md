## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

### Our Commitment 
To promote an atmosphere of openness and inclusivity, we, as contributors and maintainers, vow to ensure that participation in our project and community is free from harassment for all individuals, regardless of their age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Guidelines
Behaviors that foster a positive environment include: 
- Using inclusive and welcoming language.
- Respecting diverse viewpoints and experiences.
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully.
- Prioritizing the well-being of the community.
- Showing empathy towards fellow community members. 

Behaviors that will not be tolerated from participants include: 
* Employing sexualized language or imagery, as well as making unwelcome sexual advances or providing unsolicited sexual attention. 
* Engaging in trolling, making derogatory or insulting comments, or launching personal or political attacks. 
* Harassing others publicly or privately. 
* Sharing others' private information without explicit permission, including physical or electronic addresses. 
* Engaging in any conduct that is deemed inappropriate within a professional setting.

### Our Responsibilities
As project maintainers, we are responsible for establishing clear standards of acceptable behavior and taking appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

We have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. In addition, we may temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that we deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to both project spaces and public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting on an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Project maintainers may further define and clarify the representation of a project. 

### Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting [ajaydeshmukh@email.com](mailto:ajaydeshmukh@email.com). All complaints will be thoroughly reviewed and investigated, and appropriate actions will be taken based on the circumstances. The project team is committed to maintaining confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident. Additional details about enforcement policies may be provided separately.
